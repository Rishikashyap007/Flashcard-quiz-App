# Flashcard Quiz App

This is a Flashcard Quiz App built using React and Tailwind CSS. The app allows users to create flashcards with questions and answers, view them interactively, and quiz themselves to review and memorize key concepts.

## Features

- **Quiz Mode**: Users can start a quiz where they are shown a question and must recall the answer before flipping the card. They can mark if they got the answer right or wrong.
- **Progress Tracking**: The app tracks how many flashcards the user answered correctly and displays a score at the end of the quiz.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to work seamlessly on various screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.
- **Persistent Flashcards**: Flashcards are saved to `localStorage`, so they persist between sessions.
